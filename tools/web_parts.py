"""Our own models of the board parts KiCad's library has no model for.

tools/web_boards.py swaps a footprint's box for KiCad's part model. Some parts have no
model file in KiCad's library (the USB-C receptacle, the TRS jack, the side-entry SMD
JSTs, the power inlet, the LEDs ...). The fab house's viewer shows them, but those models
are the fab house's, and its terms keep them out of a public repository. So these are
DRAWN HERE, from what is already this project's own and from the makers' published
drawings:

  * the OUTLINE is the footprint's F.Fab body, read from the routed board;
  * the HEIGHT is the one the CAD already stands the part at (src/board_geom.py, each
    from its datasheet);
  * a panel connector's mouth and axis height are cadkit.board_geom.PANEL's, off the
    makers' drawings;
  * the detail inside that envelope (a housing's cavity and pins, a shell's tongue, a
    lens) is REPRESENTATIVE: right in kind and colour, not dimensioned.

So a part drawn here is exact where the design depends on it (where it is, how big, where
its mouth is) and a likeness elsewhere. Nothing in it is copied or measured off anybody's
model.

Every generator draws in one frame: X across the mouth and centred, Y from the mouth
face (0) back to the depth D, Z from the board (0) up to H. `build()` hands back
[(solid, (r, g, b))] in the BOARD's frame.

SAME_BODY is the other half: where KiCad's library has the same body under another
name (an inductor series by another maker, a QFN that differs in its exposed pad, which
is underneath), that model is used.
